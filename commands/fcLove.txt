You'll meet the love of your life, but you'll both be allergic to each other.
Your heart will find its perfect match, and together you'll create a love story for the ages.
Love is not about finding the perfect person but seeing an imperfect person perfectly.
The love you seek is closer than you think. Open your eyes and heart to its presence.
Love is like a treasure; once found, it fills your life with immeasurable richness.
Your love life resembles a never-ending series of romantic comedies gone wrong.
Your heart will be shattered into a million pieces. Super glue won't fix it this time.
Beware of falling in love; it's just a trap to make you believe in happily ever after.
